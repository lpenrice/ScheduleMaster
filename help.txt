	CC Schedule Master Instructions

In the opening window you will be prompted to enter your user type. Click on
the option that describes your position.

ADMINISTRATOR: If you are an administrator, you should now have the option 
to enter a .txt file containing past point distributions of CC courses. 
Press "Upload" and select the file you want to choose. Your information will be saved to the 
database.

STUDENT: If you are a student, you should now be prompted to enter your
Colorado College ID number. Type in your code and press "Enter." This will
bring you to a new window where you can browse courses and select point 
distributions.

Once you are in the student window, you may begin entering CRNs to select
courses. Be sure to press "return" on your keyboard after typing in the
number. If you do not know the CRN of the course you are looking for you
use the browse or filter features to find it.

After you have selected four courses you may use the distribute points 
button and drop down menu to have the program assign point values for you.
If you are using the ranking method you should assign your courses rankings
before distributing points.
Notice that you may still have points remaining. If this is the case, it is
recommended to manually increase the point values as you see fit.

Once points have been assigned you have the option to save your schedule. To
do this, press "Save."

RETURNING STUDENT: If you are a returning student, you have the option to 
retrieve schedules you've created in the past. First select the version 
number you'd like from the drop down menu, then press "Retrieve."
